# Facebook Messenger Bot
This is a facebook Messenger Bot I built in about a month. I live streamed the whole process on twitch and youtube.
The code is super simple and and but I wanted to share this with whoever is interested. 

I used AWS Lambda as my server and the Facebook Graph API.

You can see my livestreams at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/eufracio/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXc49__z8-6zAujyBZLGsQ)
